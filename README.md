# nineman
Nine Men's Morris implementation in Rust.

## Rules/variants
* The "flying" variant is not (currently) implemented
* ~~Currently can mill pieces from other mills (to be fixed)~~ fixed

## Play
Clone repository and run `cargo run`. Currently play is against a random player.
Change the second player to be `Human` rather than `Random` to play against another human.
See my [montyman repository](https://github.com/UsAndRufus/montyman) for a better bot.

## Pull requests
Very much welcome, but be aware this is my first Rust project and is all done fairly hastily so I can write the bot.

## crates.io
I plan to add this to ()[crates.io] at some point, but should probably add tests. Also I am too busy with the bot to work out the procedure to publish to the repository!
